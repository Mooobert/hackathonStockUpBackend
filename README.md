# hackathonStockUpBackend

This is a small prototype of how my team's application would handle creation of new user accounts, site logins, and dashboard accessibility.
Keep in mind this is still in develepment and I'll be steadily working on it when I can to improve the quality.

For the time being, account names are locally and temporarily logged since it's useful information that I would ideally record in a database if I knew how to do that,
so the console logs work as a proof of concept for what I'm trying to do. 

I'll hopefully get around to making and linking a database with the html input fields so once someone enters their username and password, those entries
will persist across page redirects, allowing me to then test whether or not those accounts are in said database when accounts and passwords are being entered in the login page,
where account_checkcer.js would come into play and verify.
